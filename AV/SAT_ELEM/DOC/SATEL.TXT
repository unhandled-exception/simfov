[AMSAT-NA] Keplerian Elements Formats

Keplerian element sets are generally distributed in one of two formats,
usually called NASA format and AMSAT format. A third format, called
one-line elements or "Charlie" elements, is sometimes seen in military
circles.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

NASA 2-Line Format

This is the format used by NASA to distribute satellite elements in their
NASA Prediction Bulletin. The origin of the format is unknown. Some old
NORAD reports refer to this as T-card format.

As used in the amateur community, the format consists of groups of 3 lines:
One line containing the satellite's name, followed by the standard Two-Line
Orbital Element Set Format identical to that used by NASA and NORAD.
Tracking programs are generally unforgiving of anything that doesn't fit
this format.

NASA format files look like this...

OSCAR 10
1 14129U          88230.56274695 0.00000042           10000-3 0  3478
2 14129  27.2218 308.9614 6028281 329.3891   6.4794  2.05877164 10960
GPS-0008
1 14189U          88230.24001475 0.00000013                   0  5423
2 14189  63.0801 108.8864 0128028 212.9347 146.3600  2.00555575 37348

Each number is in a specified fixed column. Spaces are significant. The
last digit on each line is a mod-10 check digit, which is checked by the
program. The program also checks the sequence numbers (first column), and
checks each orbital element for reasonable range. This is a very good set
of checks, so this format is very safe, and robust.

There seems to be some disagreement about how the "+" character is figured
into the check digit. If you have trouble with checksum failures on element
sets with "+" signs in them, try replacing all the "+" signs with spaces.

Data for each satellite consists of three lines in the following format:

AAAAAAAAAAA
1 NNNNNU NNNNNAAA NNNNN.NNNNNNNN +.NNNNNNNN +NNNNN-N +NNNNN-N N NNNNN
2 NNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NNNNNNN NNN.NNNN NNN.NNNN NN.NNNNNNNNNNNNNN

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Line 1

Line 1 is a eleven-character name.

Actually, there is some disagreement about how wide the name may be.  Some
programs allow 12 characters.  Others allow 24 characters, which is
consistent with some NORAD documents.

Some sources encode additional information on this line, but this is not
part of the standard format. One scheme for encoding visual magnitude
information is described in Ted Molczan's format description.

There is no checksum on this line.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Line 2

Column     Description
 01-01     Line Number of Element Data
 03-07     Satellite Number
 10-11     International Designator (Last two digits of launch year)
 12-14     International Designator (Launch number of the year)
 15-17     International Designator (Piece of launch)
 19-20     Epoch Year (Last two digits of year)
 21-32     Epoch (Day number and fractional portion of the day)
 34-43     First Time Derivative of the Mean Motion divided by 2.
        or Ballistic Coefficient (Depending of ephemeris type)
 45-52     Second Time Derivative of Mean Motion divided by 6. (Blank if N/A)
 54-61     BSTAR drag term if GP4 general perturbation theory was used.
           Otherwise, radiation pressure coefficient.
 63-63     Ephemeris type
 65-68     Element number
 69-69     Check Sum (Modulo 10)

The checksum is computed as follows:

  1. Start with zero.
  2. For each digit in the line, add the value of the digit.
  3. For each minus sign, add 1.
  4. For each plus sign, add 2 (or maybe 0, depending on who created the
     element set and when)
  5. For each letter, blank, or period, don't add anything.
  6. Take the last decimal digit of the result (that is, take the result
     modulo 10) as the check digit.

All other columns are blank or fixed.

Note that the International Designator fields are usually blank, as issued
in the NASA Prediction Bulletins.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

Line 3

Column     Description
 01-01     Line Number of Element Data
 03-07     Satellite Number
 09-16     Inclination [Degrees]
 18-25     Right Ascension of the Ascending Node [Degrees]
 27-33     Eccentricity (decimal point assumed)
 35-42     Argument of Perigee [Degrees]
 44-51     Mean Anomaly [Degrees]
 53-63     Mean Motion [Revs per day]
 64-68     Revolution number at epoch [Revs]
 69-69     Check Sum (Modulo 10)

The same checksum algorithm is used.

All other columns are blank or fixed.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

AMSAT Format

There are several very similar formats generated by several different
people that seem to be called "AMSAT" format. Tracking programs generally
try to read all of them. This format is very user-friendly, and can be
easily read and/or edited by humans. Spaces are not significant. Each
orbital element must appear on a separate line. The order in which orbital
elements appear is not significant, except that each element set should
begin with a line containing the word "satellite". A blank line is usually
interpreted as ending the element set.

This file format does not contain any check digits, but an overall checksum
is sometimes used.

AMSAT format elements as distributed by AMSAT look like this:

Satellite: AO-13
Catalog number: 19216
Epoch time:      94311.77313192
Element set:     994
Inclination:       57.6728 deg
RA of node:       221.5174 deg
Eccentricity:    0.7242728
Arg of perigee:   354.2960 deg
Mean anomaly:       0.7033 deg
Mean motion:    2.09727084 rev/day
Decay rate:      -5.78e-06 rev/day^2
Epoch rev:            4902
Checksum:              312

The checksum is the same computation as for the NASA 2-line format, except
that the whole sum is used instead of just the last digit. Every character
on the line is included, so the "2" in "rev/day^2" does count.

One-Line "Charlie" Elements Format

The One Line Element (OLE) format is a somewhat abbreviated set of data
used by the Navy at the Naval Research Laboratory (and perhaps others).
Some useful information which is included in the 2-Line Element format is
omitted, such as the Revolution Number at Epoch. Other information, such as
the International Designator, can often be obtained from other sources
using the satellite number (NORAD catalog number). The only virtue to this
format is its brevity.

The input of elements in this form may be terminated by a line which
contains a zero for the catalog number.
